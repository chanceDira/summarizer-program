He is coming.
He's almost here.

Maybe you're supposed
to come back with me.

Go back where?
Back to the world?

I'm not sure the world
wants me back.

We need to figure out
what Zeke's return

means for the bigger picture.

Ben just moved out.
The couch is free,

so you can crash here for a bit.

I love you.
It's always been you.

I can't get over what we did.
It's not right.




We're supposed
to be together, Mick.

Supposed to be or not,
we're... we're not together.

You're with Lourdes.

Jared, what's going on?

I just need some time.

Where is she?

She's gone, Mick.

Why did you tell her?

I didn't have to.
She already knew.

I want you to make him better.

There is nothing
I can do to help...

Alice.

I saw a wolf.
Or at least I imagined one.

You, too?




Aunt Michaela?

I need one of you down
on the waterfront.

Recovery of the getaway vehicle
from that armored-car heist

that went into the East River.

It's going on four days now.

The body's still inside.

Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

Hey.
Where are you taking him?

Mercy.
I've got no room.

We got a uni riding
with him already.

I can follow behind.
But he can't go to Mercy.

He's got to go to Ed Koch. What?

Nah. Mercy's closer.
No, no, trust me.

Koch has hyperbaric oxygen chambers.

For how long he's been
underwater, he's gonna need one.

We're gonna reroute to Koch.
Come on. Let's go.

The getaway car disappeared
three days ago.

Authorities are speculating
that sediment

at the river bottom
obscured its location.

Now, incredibly,
the driver's been pulled

from the vehicle, alive.

This is Michelle Park...
A van disappears in a river for days,

then suddenly reappears,
and the driver's okay?

I know.

Do you think...?

Why not?
Zeke came back.

I mean, the question is,
why no one

for an entire six weeks
since the plane returned...

And then two in one week?

Nobody knows about me.
Who's to say there aren't more?

It's Michaela.

Did you get a good look at him?

I just sent you a picture.

Ben, the guy was underwater
for over 80 hours.

He should be a bloated corpse
right now. He should be dead.

Maybe he wasn't underwater
the whole time.

Maybe it's some kind of scam
we're just not seeing yet.

No, you wouldn't be saying that

if you saw the way
he just jumped out of his skin.

He jumped at me.

Which is exactly what Cal drew.
The wolf.

You think this guy's one of us?

Meet me at Koch in 20 minutes.

Mick's headed to this hospital
with this guys. I've...

Yeah, yeah. Go. The kids are asleep.
I want answers, too.
