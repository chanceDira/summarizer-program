The following text fades in over black:

This is a true story. The events depicted took place in
Minnesota in 2006. At the request of the survivors, the
names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the
rest has been told exactly as it occurred.

                                          FLARE TO WHITE:

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY. RURAL MINNESOTA - DAY

The white becomes snowfall, a blizzard. Through it we can
make out a two lane road. A car emerges from the snow --
rust-spotted, chains on the tires -- coming towards us.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CAR (TRAVELING) - DAY

LORNE MALVO, age unknown, birth place unknown, sits behind
the wheel, his breath white with frost. If he minds he
doesn’t show it.

As he drives we become aware of THUMPING coming from inside
the trunk. As if someone is in there who doesn’t want to be.
Malvo ignores it.

A DEER

appears in the road ahead of him. Malvo turns too late, HITS
it. The CAR SKIDS off the road, ROLLS twice -- the trunk
popping open -- before coming to rest on its wheels.

Beat. A MAN emerges from the trunk wearing only underwear.
He is stunned from the crash, but sound enough of mind to
know this is his chance. As we watch he LOPES off through
waist-deep snow, making for the tree line.

Beat. The driver’s door opens. Slowly, Malvo climbs out.
His head is bleeding where it hit the windshield. He stands
unsteadily in the snow, getting his bearings.

ANGLE ON THE OTHER MAN

Loping off through the snow. Malvo could catch him if he
tried, but he makes no attempt. Instead he walks into the
center of the road where the deer lays on its side,
struggling to get up. Three of its four legs are broken, but
still it fights for life. Malvo stands over the wounded
animal, looking down.
                                                            2.


CLOSE UP ON THE DEER

It’s eyes wild, blood bubbles foaming from its nose and
mouth, mortally wounded.

CLOSE UP ON MALVO

Studying it’s eyes.    What does he see in there?

We begin to hear a strange throbbing, churning sound, half
animal, half machine.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

LESTER NYGAARD, 40, home for lunch, sits at the kitchen
table. Lester is the kind of guy who apologizes when you
step on his foot. His wife, PEARL, 39, is heating up a can
of soup at the stove. We get the sense she has been talking
nonstop since Lester walked in the door.

                    PEARL
          -- Saturday. I said we’d bring a
          Jello salad, but Kitty said
          meatloaf, so --

The surging, churning sound is louder now, coming from under
the floor. Nygaard listens to it, both fascinated and
slightly disturbed.

                       PEARL (CONT’D)
                 (exasperated)
          Hon?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (snaps out of it)
          What’s that, hon?

Pearl brings the pot over, ladles tomato soup into his bowl.

                    PEARL
              (exasperated)
          I said it’s Scotty’s birthday
          Saturday. We’re supposed ta be at
          your brother’s at one. With
          meatloaf.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (beat, listening)
          It sounds different today, don’t ya
          think? Angry.
                                                          3.


                      PEARL
            I’m washing towels.   That’s the
            towel sound.

She sits.   They eat.

                      PEARL (CONT’D)
            Kitty says they just got one of
            those fancy European all in ones.
            Says it washes and dries. One
            machine. Can you believe that?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            I bet that set them back a penny.

                      PEARL
            He can afford it, your brother.
            Kitty said he just got a big
            promotion. After only working
            there a year.

We can tell his brother is a touchy subject for Lester.

                      PEARL (CONT’D)
            Kitty said they got one of those
            new surround-sound systems too.
                (Lester eats)
            Guess I married the wrong Nygaard.
            That’s what I said. We had a good
            laugh.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            It’s just slow now. At the shop.

                     PEARL
            Oh, hon. That’s what you always
            say. Slow.

Beat.   They eat. Lester wipes his mouth, stands.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
            Well, better get back to it.

                      PEARL
            You make your own wins. That’s
            what Kitty said Ron told her.
            Salesmen make their own wins. You
            gotta try harder, hon. Smile, for
            Pete sake. Maybe wear a nicer tie.

                      LESTER NYGAARD
                (looks down)
            You gave me this tie.
                                                           4.


                    PEARL
          Well, if you were a better
          salesman, I’da bought you a nicer
          tie.

The sound of the washing machine takes on a new urgency.

                    PEARL (CONT’D)
          At least take a look. I keep
          thinking maybe it’s the settings.
          Kitty said Ron fixes things around
          the house all the time. Says he
          took the toaster apart over the
          weekend. Good as new now. Browns
          to beat the band.

Lester’s jaw is tight.   He opens the door to the basement.

INT. BASEMENT. NYGAARD HOUSE - DAY

Lester stands at the bottom of the stairs. The washing
machine is acting like a caged animal, roaring and bucking.
Lester stares at it, hypnotized. We get the sense he’s
looking at his own trapped heart.

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. INSURANCE AGENCY. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - DAY

Lester Nygaard sits across from a YOUNG COUPLE.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          So, that’s -- like I said, there’s
          two kinds of policies you should be
          thinking about. You got your Whole
          Life and your Whole Life Plus.
          Which is -- has all the benefits of
          Whole Life -- plus a heck of a lot
          more.

                    YOUNG MAN
          We just came in to get Charline on

                    SUE ROUNDTREE
          Lester Nygaard. He was here around
          four in the P.M.

                    MOLLY
          You remember what they were arguing
          about?
                                                          47.


                    SUE ROUNDTREE
          Well, ya know, it’s funny, but I
          wanna say they were arguing about
          that dead fella.

                     MOLLY
          Who?

                     SUE ROUNDTREE
          Hess.

                    MOLLY
              (that’s interesting)
          Really.

                    SUE ROUNDTREE
              (nodding)
          Ya. Heard ‘em say his name.   Is
          that, like, a lead?

                     MOLLY
          Oh ya.

Molly nods absently for a moment, thinking jackpot.

          Phone call, chief.   It’s the wife.

                    IDA
          I decided. We’re gonna paint the
          nursery white.

                    VERN
          It’s already white.

                    IDA
          White on purpose.

          Eggshell.

                     VERN
          Right.   There’s eggshell.

                    IDA
          Oh. Hadn’t thoughta those.

Vern realizes he’s opened a whole other can of worms.

                    VERN
          Tell ya what. Why don’t I stop at
          the Home Depot, pick up some
          different shades and we’ll figure
          it out tonight?

                    IDA
          We’re havin’ a baby, Vern.

                    VERN
          That’s true.

                      IDA
          No.    I mean, it’s finally sinkin’
          in.    We’re gonna have a baby.

EXT. HOSPITAL. ST. CLOUD, MN - SAME TIME

Molly stands beside her prowler outside the hospital.

                    MOLLY
          Chief, I’m over at the hospital. I
          was checkin on the Hess boy and --

                       VERN
          How is he?

                    MOLLY
          Uh, he’s, uh -- you know, there
          could be some brain damage.

                    VERN
          That’s a shame.

                    MOLLY
          Ya. Hey, so I got ta talkin to Sue
          Roundtree, and I asked her if
          they’d had any head injuries lately
          -- ya know my theory about the
          driver in that wreck -- and Sue
          says they did yesterday. A
          peculiar fella, she says. Real
          intense. And here’s where it gets
          interesting. Cause she says the
          fella with the head injury was
          talkin to another fella. About Sam
          Hess.
                                                       50.


                     VERN
          Oh yeah?

                    MOLLY
          Yessir. Says the two was thick as
          thieves. So suddenly I’m thinking,
          maybe these two cases, maybe
          they’re connected, huh?

                     VERN
              (impressed)
          Could be. She say who the other
          fella was?

          Really.

                    MOLLY
          You know him.

                    VERN
          Sure. I know Lester. Sells
          insurance over at Bo’s shop.

                    MOLLY
          Ya. I called over. They’re closed.
          So I was gonna go by Lester’s
          place.

                    VERN
          No. I know Lester. I’ll do it.
          You call it a day. Good work.

INT. BASEMENT. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MINNESOTA - NIGHT

Pearl comes downstairs. Lester has his tool kit out.   He’s
trying to fix the washing machine.

                    PEARL
          Whatcha doin’, hon?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Trying ta fix the darn thing.
          Looks like the motor mount broke.

                    PEARL
          Ya sure ya know what yer doin’?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Seems pretty straight forward.

He puts the screwdriver down.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
          Okay. Give that a try.

                    PEARL
          But there’s nothing in it.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          I’m sayin’ just fer a test.

Pearl turns the machine on. Beat. It fills with water, then
the agitator kicks in. A harsh shriek fills the air.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
              (panicked)
          Turn it off.

Pearl tries to turn it off. The shriek worsens. SMOKE
starts to pour out of the back of the washing machine.
Lester finally pulls the plug. The shriek fades slowly, as
the engine cycles down.

They stare at the now dead washing machine.

                     LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
          Well --

                    PEARL
          You killed it.

                     LESTER NYGAARD
          I, uh --

                    PEARL
          You killed my washing machine.
                                                          52.


                    LESTER NYGAARD
          It’s -- I was -- ya know, the tide.
          I was standing up to the -- I was
          bein’ a man.

                    PEARL
          But yer not a man, Lester.    Yer not
          even half a man.

Lester stares at her, his nuts cut once again.

                    PEARL (CONT’D)
          Honestly. I don’t know what got
          into me, marrying you. My mom
          said, don’t do it, Pearl. She
          said, he’s the kind of boy who
          loses all the time. And you know
          what those boys grow up ta be,
          don’t ya? Losers.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Take it back.

                    PEARL
          Or what? What are you gonna do?
          Ya can’t even face me when we’re
          having sex.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What? It’s you not facin’ me.

                       PEARL
          Well, yah.     So I can picture a real
          man.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Now that’s not very nice.

                       PEARL
          Loser.

Lester picks up the claw hammer.    He walks towards Pearl.

                    PEARL (CONT’D)
          What are you doon? You gonna hit
          me with a hammer? That’s a laugh.
                                                          53.


The first blow catches her by surprise. The pain of it, the
blood that runs down her face. The moment hangs there. Then
Lester BEATS HER TO DEATH with the hammer. Each blow is a
release. Eventually, he stops. Stands there panting.
Slowly the red haze lifts. He looks down at his blood
spattered clothes.

                       LESTER NYGAARD
            Aw geez.

He is about to panic, when he looks up.

CLOSE UP ON AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER

taped to a bare concrete wall. On it a school of yellow fish
all face the same direction, except one. The poster reads
There’s Always One. Be the One.

LESTER

Stares at it. As he does, an idea hits him. A brilliant,
dangerous plan. Could he really do it? As we watch, Lester
strips off his clothes, shoves them in a garbage bag.

Carefully Lester wipes the handle of the claw hammer to
remove his finger prints. Over this we hear:

                       LESTER NYGAARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                (pre-lap, distraught)
            Ya, it’s me. I -- you need ta -- I
            need help.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MIN - NIGHT

Lester, dressed in new clothing, stands with his back to us.
We move towards him as he practices for his phone call.

                       LESTER NYGAARD
            Ya, it’s me. I can’t talk long.
            She’s -- I did something --
                (beat)
            Ya, it’s -- there’s been an
            accident and I --

Beat.    He picks up the phone, dials.

                                              INTERCUT WITH:

INT. FARMDALE MOTEL. SAINT CLOUD, MN - SAME TIME

Malvo sits on his bed, watching tv. The phone rings, which
is strange, because no one has this number.
                                                             54.


                       MALVO
                 (answers)
          Yes?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (worked up)
          Ya, it’s me -- Lester -- she’s --
          my wife, she’s -- aw hell -- she’s
          in the basement, and --

                    MALVO
          How did you get this number?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What? I was -- I saw you this
          morning on my way ta -- look, I’m
          freakin’ out here -- I don’t know
          what ta do.

                    MALVO
          Lester, have you been a bad boy?

                   LESTER NYGAARD
          Aw geez. I just -- can you come
          over? It’s -- I’m on Willow Creek
          Drive. Number six thirteen.

                    MALVO
              (beat, thinking)
          Sure, Lester. I’ll be right there.

Lester hangs up.    Beat.   He thinks about his next step.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM. NYGAARD HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

Lester pulls a chair over to the armoire. He climbs up,
roots around on top, pulls down a SHOTGUN. He finds some
shells, loads it. Malvo will be here soon and Lester plans
to kill him and frame him for his wife’s murder.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALLWAY. NYGAARD HOUSE - NIGHT

Lester holds the gun in one hand. Practices opening the door
with the other, raising the gun. It’s too clunky. Plus he
needs to lure Malvo inside the house before he shoots him.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (practicing)
          What did you do? You killed her.
          You killed her.
                                                          55.


Lester looks around. He decides to hide the shotgun against
the LIVING ROOM WALL, just on the other side of the doorway.

Looking around, Lester loses his nerve a little. But no.     He
has a plan. This will work. He sets the shotgun in its
hiding place, looks around. Has he forgotten anything?

THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR

Lester panics, tries to calm down.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
              (under his breath)
          You killed her. You killed her.

Lester goes to the front door, takes a deep breath, opens it.

VERN THURMAN stands outside.

                    VERN
          Evenin’, Lester.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
              (nervous)
          What -- what do ya want?

                    VERN
          Well, I suppose first I’d like ta
          come in.

Lester looks behind him.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Uh, ya. Well -- it’s just -- now’s
          not a good --

                    VERN
          Just take a second.

Vern steps forward and Lester, by instinct, steps back.   Now
Vern is in the house. He takes off his gloves and hat.

                    VERN (CONT’D)
          Supposed ta get down to negative
          ten tonight, I hear.

Lester is a mass of nerves.    Vern steps towards the kitchen.

                    VERN (CONT’D)
          Pearl home?

Lester moves to block him, putting his back to the kitchen
doorway.
                                                       56.


                     LESTER NYGAARD
          Uh -- no -- she’s, uh -- at my
          brother’s.

                       VERN
          Okay then.     How’s the nose?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          Huh?    Oh, hurts.

                    VERN
          How’d that happen anyway?

                     LESTER NYGAARD
          Slipped.   Over at the fire station.

                     VERN
          Ouch.   Go to the hospital?

                      LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya.    They, uh, set it.

                    VERN
          Talk to anyone while you were
          there?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          What do ya mean?

                    VERN
          Well, the reason I’m here -- not
          sure if ya heard -- but Sam Hess
          got himself killed last night over
          at the Lucky Penny. Nasty business.
          And, well, I heard you were talkin’
          to another fella about Hess before
          he died. Over at the hospital.

                     LESTER NYGAARD
              (pale)
          No. I don’t think --

                    VERN
          What was his name again? The other
          fella?

Lester tries to decide what to say. Then the cuckoo clock
chimes from the living room. 8 o’clock. Lester jumps,
startled.

                     VERN (CONT’D)
          Ya okay there, Lester? Ya seem a
          bit jumpy.
                                                        57.


                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Ya, I’m, uh -- it’s just Pearl’s
          gonna be home soon and --

Looking past Lester, Vern sees the basement door is open.   He
notices something on the floor. A BLOODY FOOTPRINT.
Alarmed, Vern DRAWS HIS GUN.

                    VERN
          Lester. Listen to me very
          carefully. I need ya to get down
          on the ground.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          No. Wait. Just -- listen to me --
          it’s not what it --

                    VERN
          Lester. On the ground. Now.

Gun on Lester, Vern backs into the kitchen.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          No. Now hold on. Hold on. Don’t -
          - there’s nothin’ down there --

Vern glances down the basement stairs.

ANGLE ON PEARL’S FEET

Visible at the bottom of the stairs.

                    LESTER NYGAARD (CONT’D)
          -- That’s not -- I didn’t do
          nothin’ -- I just got home. I just
          got home and --

CLOSE UP ON VERN

Trying to catch up to events. He keeps the gun on Lester,
reenters the front hall. With his free hand, he keys his
radio handset

                    VERN
          This is Chief Thurman. I’m at six
          one three Willow Creek Drive.
          Requesting --

A SHOTGUN BLAST catches VERN in the BACK, spins him around.

REVEAL: LORNE MALVO holds LESTER’S SHOTGUN. It’s 8 PM, and
Malvo has come in through the back door. He FIRES AGAIN, the
spray catching Vern in the chest and throat. Vern falls.
                                                            58.


                      MALVO
          Any more?

Lester is in shock, white as a sheet.

                      MALVO (CONT’D)
          Lester.    Are there any more cops?

Lester shakes his head.   Malvo kicks Vern’s gun away, looks
down.

ANGLE ON VERN

Eyes wild, like the deer in the opening. He is mortally
wounded, blood bubbles coming out of his mouth as he
struggles for air.

CLOSE UP ON MALVO

Struck by the synchronicity of this.    He studies the dying
man’s eyes.

                    MALVO (CONT’D)
          What did you tell him?

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          Nothing -- I, uh -- he asked about
          Sam.

                    MALVO
          You got any more shells for this?

Lester shakes his head.   Malvo lays the shotgun on the table.

                    MALVO (CONT’D)
          Where’s the basement?

Lester points.    Malvo enters the kitchen, goes down the
stairs.

ANGLE ON LESTER

He pulls two shotgun shells out of his pocket, eyes the
shotgun. How long to grab it and reload?

He reaches out his other hand, then realizes it’s bleeding.
There’s a shotgun pellet buried in the meat of his thumb.
Then Lester becomes aware that his injured hand is now lit by
flashing red and blue lights. Another police car has just
pulled up outside.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. MOLLY’S SQUAD CAR - SAME TIME

Pulling up to Nygaard’s house, Molly sees Vern’s prowler.
She CLIMBS OUT of the car, approaches the door.

Lester hurries over to the basement door.

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          They’re here. The police.

No response.   Lester starts down the stairs into ...

THE BASEMENT

                    LESTER NYGAARD
          I said the police are here.   What
          do we ...

But Malvo is gone. Vanished like a ghost. Pearl lays alone
on the floor, a bloody mess. The hammer next to her.

Off Lester: trapped.

Molly pounds on the door.

                    MOLLY
          Saint Cloud Police.   Open up.

Nothing. She looks in the nearest window, sees Vern laying
dead on the hall floor.

                    MOLLY (CONT’D)
              (upset)
          Oh. Oh.

She keys her handset.

          Officer -- officer down! Send help.

She pulls her weapon, starts kicking the front door.

INT. BASEMENT. NYGAARD HOUSE - SAME TIME

Nygaard hears the front door CRASH OPEN upstairs. He is
trapped. He looks around. No exit. Can he hide? No. They’ll
find him. Then his eyes hit the inspirational poster on the
wall. There’s only one way out. Lester, knowing he will be
found at any moment, RUNS towards the wall, his head down.
Crack. He knocks himself out.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FRONT HALLWAY. NYGAARD HOUSE - SAME TIME

Molly kneels next to Vern, checks his pulse. But her mentor
and friend is dead. Struggling to stay professional, she
straightens, her gun up.

                    MOLLY
          Saint Cloud Police! If there’s
          someone in the house, come out with
          yer hands up.

Nothing. Cautiously, Molly goes room to room, searching. We
know Malvo could still be in the house. Each blind corner
and dark space offers certain death. We can tell Molly is
afraid, out of her league, but she keeps her wits.

INT. BASEMENT. NYGAARD HOUSE - NIGHT

Slowly, Molly comes down the stairs, gun drawn. She sees
Pearl and Lester, laying face down. The basement looks like
the scene of a massacre. From upstairs she hears ...

                       BILL (O.S.)
          Molly?

                       MOLLY
          Down here!

Molly assesses the situation. Pearl is clearly dead. Molly
holsters her weapon, kneels next to Lester, takes his pulse.

                    MOLLY (CONT’D)
          Husband’s alive!

She looks up. There on the poster she sees A BLOODY HUMAN
FACE PRINT with what appears to be a HALO over it.

There’s always one.    Be the one.

Gus hits his siren, pulls out onto the road. We stay with
him as he follows the speeding car, it’s tail lights visible
through the front windshield.

The car in front of him pulls over. Gus pulls in behind it.
Beat. He writes down the license plate number, notes the
time. Then climbs out of the car.

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY. RURAL MINNESOTA - CONTINUOUS

Gus approaches the driver’s side, flashlight out. The inside
of the car is dark, ominous. We can’t see the driver.

Then the driver’s side window rolls down.    Now we see the
driver is Lorne Malvo.

                    MALVO
          Evening, officer.

                    MALVO
          Well, we could do it that way. You
          ask me for my papers and I tell you
          it’s not my car. That I borrowed
          it. And see where things go from
          there. We could do that. Or, you
          could just get back in your car and
          drive away.

                    GUS GRIMLY
          Why would I do that?

                    MALVO
          Because some roads you shouldn’t go
          down. Because maps used to say
          there be dragons here. And now
          they don’t. But that don’t mean
          the dragons aren’t there.

From the prowler, we hear Kurt’s walkie talkie.

                     KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
          Dad.   Come in, dad. Over.

                    GUS GRIMLY
          Step out of the car, please.

                    MALVO
          How old is your son?

Gus puts his hand on his revolver.
                                                         63.


                     GUS GRIMLY
           I said step out of the car.

                      KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
           Dad.   Come in, dad. Over.

                     MALVO
           Let me tell you what’s going to
           happen, Officer Grimly. I’m gonna
           roll up my window. And then I’m
           gonna drive away. And you’re gonna
           go home to your son. And every few
           years you’re gonna look at his face
           and know that you’re alive because
           you chose not to go down a certain
           road on a certain night. Because
           you chose to walk into the light,
           instead of into darkness. Do you
           understand?

                      GUS GRIMLY
           Sir.

                     MALVO
           I’m rolling up my window.

The window rolls up. Gus stands there, knowing he should
pull his gun. That he should order Malvo out of the car, but
something stops him. The feeling the rabbit gets in the
presence of the wolf.

So he stands there as Malvo’s car pulls away.

                      KURT GRIMLY (O.S.)
           Dad.   Come in, dad. Over.

Gus walks back to the car, climbs in, closes the door.   Beat.
He picks up the walkie talkie.

                     GUS GRIMLY
           Dad here. Over.

                      KURT GRIMLY
           Detroit just got a touchdown. Over.
               (beat)
           Dad? Are you there? Over.

Beat.   Gus sits, shaken.

                     GUS GRIMLY
           I hear ya. We’ll get ‘em in the
           fourth. And hey, don’t forget ta do
           yer English homework, okay? I love
           you.
                                                          64.


A long silence.

                    KURT GRIMLY
          Ya didn’t say over. Over.

                    GUS GRIMLY
              (smiles)
          Over and out.

Beat. Gus sits in his warm car, while outside the
temperature drops. Then he picks up his note pad, examines
Malvo’s license plate number.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. LESTER’S HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

It’s really snowing now. Every police car in town is there,
along with fire trucks and an ambulance. Patrolmen go in and
out of the house. Molly sits on a planter by the front door,
in shock.

Inside the lobby we can see Vern’s body covered with a
blanket. After a moment, Molly gets to her feet and walks
down the driveway.

She passes Vern’s prowler.   Something inside catches her eye.

ANGLE ON TWO CANS OF HOUSE PAINT

In the back seat.

MOLLY

Stands looking in at them, and all they represent.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. VERN’S HOUSE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - NIGHT

Molly’s car pulls up. She gets out, grabs the paint cans,
starts for the house. There are responsibilities she will
take on now, unspoken promises that must be kept.

The front door opens. Ida comes out.   She knows from Molly’s
face that the worst has happened.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. ST. CLOUD, MN - DAY

Lester is in bed, unconscious. His head is bandaged.     He
looks terrible. Outside, snow falls. He wakes up.
                                                        65.


Gets his bearings. He is in the hospital. Not dead. Better
still, he is not handcuffed to the bed. There are no cops.

Could it be? Could he have gotten away with it? He lifts
his right hand to get some water, sees the BANDAGE.

He examines the spot where the shotgun pellet caught him.   On
his face is a hint of uncertainty.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ICE. SAINT CLOUD, MN - DAY

Molly’s dad, Lou, unpacks fishing gear from the back of his
Suburban. Molly, in civilian clothes, sits on the tailgate,
looking out at the snow. Her prowler is parked nearby.

                     LOU
           I got two kinds of sandwiches.
           Tuna and turkey.
               (beat, off her)
           Tuna’s for the fish. Unless ya
           think they’d think that’s
           cannibalism.

Molly doesn’t answer.   Lou offloads a cooler.

                     LOU (CONT’D)
           Nice service yesterday, I thought.
           Simple.

Beat.   Molly is lost in thought.

                     LOU (CONT’D)
           Ya know, I been looking for some
           more help at the restaurant.
           Someone to seat customers. Answer
           the phones.

                      MOLLY
               (absently)
           A hostess.

                     LOU
           That what they call it? Anyway,
           not sure if that was somethin’ you
           might be interested in.

                     MOLLY
               (this gets a look)
           I’m a police officer, dad.
                                                          66.


                     LOU
           Well, sure. I know that. I also
           know that people in this world are
           less inclined to shoot a hostess,
           than, say, an officer of the law.

                      MOLLY
               (beat)
           That’s true.

He kicks snow off his boots.

                     LOU
           So, does that mean you’re gonna
           help yer old man out?

                      MOLLY
           No. But maybe you could put that
           in the ad.

Molly jumps down from the tailgate.

                     MOLLY (CONT’D)
           On second thought, I’m gonna head
           in ta work. Coroner’s report should
           be in. Rain check on the fishin’?

He nods.   She kisses his cheek.

                     MOLLY (CONT’D)
           Love ya, dad.

                     LOU
           Love ya too, hon.

Molly walks to her cruiser.    Her father watches as we ...
